# What is MBR? 
#### MBR stands for Master Boot Record. It is a small section located at the beginning of a storage device, such as a hard disk drive or solid-state drive, that contains essential information for the booting process of a computer, The MBR holds the primary partition table, which describes the layout of partitions on the storage device. It also contains the boot loader code, which is responsible for loading the operating system from a specific partition.  The MBR has a size of 512 bytes :)

# Overwriting MBR 
### Overwriting the Master Boot Record (MBR) is a delicate operation that should be approached with caution. Modifying or overwriting the MBR can have significant consequences and potentially render the system unbootable if not done correctly.
